# QMortality Python

[QMortality®-2017](https://qmortality.org) algorithm re-written in python.

The orginial QMortality®-2017 algorithm is written in C, and is available on the [website here](https://qmortality.org/src.php), as well as in [`qmortality.c`](./qmortality.c) in this repository.

Please note that this is a re-implementation of the algorithm, and although the output of both the original and this implementation should be the same (testing of such is performed in [`tests/test_qmort.py`](./tests/test_qmort.py)), there is no guarantee that this is the case. Please see the additional terms below.

## Additional Terms
```
  The following disclaimer must be held together with any risk score score generated by this code.  
  If the score is displayed, then this disclaimer must be displayed or otherwise be made easily accessible, e.g. by a prominent link alongside it.
    The initial version of this file, to be found at http://qmortality.org, faithfully implements QMortality-2017.
    ClinRisk Ltd. have released this code under the GNU Affero General Public License to enable others to implement the algorithm faithfully.
    However, the nature of the GNU Affero General Public License is such that we cannot prevent, for example, someone accidentally 
    altering the coefficients, getting the inputs wrong, or just poor programming.
    ClinRisk Ltd. stress, therefore, that it is the responsibility of the end user to check that the source that they receive produces the same 
    results as the original code found at http://qmortality.org.
    Inaccurate implementations of risk scores can lead to wrong patients being given the wrong treatment.
